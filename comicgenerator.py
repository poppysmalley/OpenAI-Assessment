After days of traveling, Max stumbles upon an ancient, overgrown entrance covered in vines. He pushes through the thick foliage, revealing the mysterious temple. Itâ€™s made of stone, with intricate carvings of forgotten gods.
Max carefully enters the temple and discovers a large chamber. In the center of the room lies a glowing artifact. As he approaches it, he feels the weight of history and destiny upon him. With one final look at the artifact, Max grabs it, and the temple begins to shake.
He races out just as the temple collapses behind him, narrowly escaping with the artifact in hand. Max returns to the village as a hero, the artifact now in his possession, its secrets ready to be unlocked."""
